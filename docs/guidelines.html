      	<h1 id="guidelines">GUIDELINES</h1>

<p>ikigai is an free digital fanzine focused on Kageyama Tobio, Oikawa Tooru, and Sugawara Koushi from Haikyuu!! This zine looks to showcase works that explore the three characters individually and in relation to one another, be it platonic or romantic.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual zine media of fanart and fanfiction, we will also be accepting other media as well: figurine shoots, cosplays, poems, playlists, collages, etc. All content should follow the guidelines and any other guidelines that you believe closely align with your chosen media.</p>

<h2 id="general-guidelines">General Guidelines</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>This zine is a 100% free, non-profit, digital-only project.</strong></li>
  <li>Everyone is welcome to participate as long as they are <strong>18 or older</strong>. Previous zine experience is not necessary.</li>
  <li>All contributors must submit the sign-up form to contribute to the fan collection (but everyone who submits is accepted as long as they final piece(s) follow the guidelines).</li>
  <li>The main zine will be SFW, but there would be an added NSFW mini zine depending on the interest check through the applications. NSFW could include works with mature and explicit themes, including themes often tagged as dead dove.</li>
  <li>Please <strong>tag any potentially triggering content</strong> in the SFW works. All NSFW works must be strictly tagged.</li>
  <li>All works must be centered around <strong>Kageyama, Suga, and/or Oikawa</strong>. Platonic and/or romantic ship works are allowed, as long as it is between any of the three main characters of this zine. (<em>Or all three. #oikagesuga ftw!!</em>)</li>
  <li>Double-check that all social links, contact email, and discord handles are correct. We will not be liable if you cannot be reached through any of your submitted socials.</li>
  <li>Mods will communicate with contributors via Discord and email. Announcements will also be on Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram.Soft check-ins will be done periodically via Discord.</li>
  <li>We welcome works set in the canonverse or in an alternate universe (AU).</li>
  <li><strong>All work submitted must be their own creation.</strong> Submitting others’ works is prohibited. Using others’ works such as songs or photos are only allowed for the playlists.</li>
  <li>Collaborative works are allowed, provided that you and your collaborator/s are all signed up for the event.
Works must be <strong>new and unpublished</strong>. During the creation period, you are more than welcome to share very small snippets and sneak peeks, but you may not preview the entire piece.
WIPs that haven’t been posted in any way are welcome. New works based on an existing already work you have previously made are also welcome.
Contributors can submit up to <strong>THREE (3)</strong> piece(s) across any content type to the zine. (For example, a fic, a playlist, and printable coloring page; OR three poems; OR an illustration, a playlist, and a character essay  all count as a contributor’s 3 fanworks and they would not be allowed to submit another piece.) NSFW works will be counted separately.
All work created for the fan collection can be published on the platforms of your choice <strong>ONE (1) month</strong> after the collection release date. (We’re targeting January 29, 2024, which is oikagesuga day!)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="literary-guidelines">Literary Guidelines</h2>

<p>Literary submissions include fanfiction, poems, essays, screenplays, etc. Please take note of the following guidelines for your output:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In addition to the traditional fics, we will also be accepting poems, screenplays, essays, and other similar written submissions from writer contributors. Poems should be no more than 400 words, while other written works can be anywhere between 500-3500 words.</li>
  <li>SFW works must fall strictly within the G to T ratings, while NSFW works would fall under M to E ratings, following AO3 guidelines. (If you’re unsure, you can always ask our Mod Team. General rule, the work should not go past a soft make out.)</li>
  <li>Please make sure your work/s comply with our General Guidelines; otherwise it may result in automatic rejection of your entry.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="visual-media-guidelines">Visual Media Guidelines</h2>

<p>Visual media submissions include fanart, comics, digital/printable merch, any photography, etc. Please take note of the following guidelines for your output:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All output must be at least:
    <ul>
      <li>300dpi</li>
      <li>In RGB format</li>
      <li>In .png or .jpg</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For page artists, one page would be A5 size, portrait orientation.</li>
  <li>Due to the current formatting software we have, we’ll only be able to format with a uniform page number. Hence, two-page spreads will either be split into two separate pages cut directly in the middle of the artwork, or would be put in a singular page focused on the subject of the piece, cutting out much of the sides of the artwork. However, we would format a separate double-spread version of the zine to showcase page spreads in its entirety.</li>
  <li>For merch artists, feel free to follow any sizes/dimensions that suit your digital merch outputs, but kindly adapt the following specifications. Should you want to create printable merch, we are allowing a change in format from RGB to CMYK.</li>
  <li>We will accept outputs in monochrome (black and white), flat color, and full color/full render.</li>
  <li>We will accept traditional artwork as long as it is scanned in high quality.</li>
  <li>We accept any sort of photography as long as it is your own work, as long as it follows our format.</li>
  <li>For collages and similar works, using others’ artworks isn’t allowed.</li>
  <li>Please make sure your artwork/s comply with our General Guidelines; otherwise it may result in automatic rejection of your entry.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="playlist-guidelines">Playlist Guidelines</h2>

<p>Please take note of the following guidelines for your output:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Songs included in the playlist should refrain from heavily explicit language. Mature and explicit songs (such as playlists that are, say, inspired by two setters’ sexual encounters), will be included in the NSFW zine.</li>
  <li>Using other artists’ works as the playlist cover is prohibited unless it is a collaboration with an artist in the zine.</li>
  <li>You are free to link a playlist to your streaming platform of choice. Clickable links in the zine will be available.</li>
  <li>Please make sure your playlist/s comply with our General Guidelines; otherwise it may result in automatic rejection of your entry.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-other-works">Guidelines for Other Works</h2>

<p>Let us know through the application form what you have in mind that isn’t listed above, and we’ll talk about it! <strong>General Guidelines</strong> still apply; otherwise it may result in automatic rejection of your entry.</p>

<p>For any questions/concerns, you may reach us through Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, or on our FAQ page.</p>
